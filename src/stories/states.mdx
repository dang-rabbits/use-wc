# States

Elements can have various states and we strive to support these in every web component where applicable:

- Static
- Hover
- Focus
- Active
- Checked
- Selected
- Disabled
- Readonly
- Required
- Valid
- Invalid
- Busy
- Pressed

## Notes

1. `:focus-visible` doesn't work with `delegateFocus` across all browsers (see https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5893)
