# `use-grid`

## Markup

This should follow the same patterns as an HTML-standard `table` component and its children, except the elements will all be custom to improve performance and allow easier styling, accessibility, and functionality.

The custom elements will be as follows:

- `table` will be `use-grid`
- `thead` will be `use-gridhead` with a default `role` of `'rowgroup'`
- `tbody` will be `use-gridbody` with a default `role` of `'rowgroup'`
- `tr` will be `use-gridrow` with a default `role` of `'row'`
- `th` will be `use-gridcell`
  - when inside `use-gridheader` the default `role` will be `'columnheader'`
  - when inside `use-gridbody` the default `role` will be `'rowheader'`
- `td` will be `use-gridcell` with a default `role` of `'gridcell'`

## Shadow DOM

Shadow DOM will not be used for the following reasons:

- Overriding `tabindex` is more difficult with Shadow DOM
- Delegate focus is complicated for unknown children

## Selection

The `use-grid` web component should hold a `FormData` state as a `value` property for row selection. Row selection will be enabled with a custom `selectmode?: 'multiple' | 'single' | 'none'` attribute, with a default of `'none'`. The `value` property should be a custom getter function that scans the nested `use-gridrow` for a `selected` state.

Similar to the `use-listbox` and `use-tree` components, we will provide a default checkmark indicator for when a row is selected.

## States

### `use-gridcell`

- **Focus** â€” this will come for free with `tabindex` being set and standard `:focus` CSS selectors

### `use-gridrow`

- **Selected** â€” a custom state needs to be implemented for when a row is selected and part of the `use-grid`'s form value
- **Disabled** â€” this will utilize the HTML standard `disabled` prop and will prevent selection

## Accessibility

### Keyboard navigation

Users must be able to navigate `use-gridcell` and `use-gridcolumnheader` by using the `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `ArrowLeft`, and `ArrowRight` keys. `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Home`, `End`, `Control + [Home|End]`, keys need to be supported too. The logic can be derived from [Grid (Interactive Tabular Data and Layout Containers) Pattern | APG | WAI | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/)

To make this work, `use-gridcell`, `use-gridrowheader`, and `use-gridcolumnheader` need to have `tabindex="-1"` by default and then `tabindex="0"` when it is the active cell. `tabindex="-1"` is important so there isnâ€™t lag when programmatically calling `cell.focus()`

Nested controls:

- Tabbable controls inside a cell should have its `tabindex` set to `-1` and a custom data prop to remember the original value, which could be `'initial'`
- When a non-header cell has more than one tabbable element then the cell itself becomes focused, and the user must press `Enter` or `F2` to focus into the control. Similarly, the user must press `Escape` or `F2` to restore grid navigation. When a cell is activated and the user uses `Tab` to navigate outside the `use-grid` then the grid navigation must be restored.
- When a non-header cell has no tabbable elements then the cell is focused.
- When a non-header cell has one tabbable element then that element becomes focused instead of the parent cell.
  - If the tabbable element implements its own arrow key controls, such as a dropdown with `ArrowDown` or a native input with `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` then the cell should implement the _widget_ _mode_ as if the cell has more than one control.
  - This works best when the tabbable element is either a standalone button without a dropdown, a link, or checkbox.
  - Tabbable elements that delegate focus should also follow the _widget_ _mode_.

### Keyboard controls

- To select a row the user must press `Shift + Space`
- Headers can only contain one tabbable element, which is generally the cell or label, but additional controls may be available for mouse-users as long as there is alternative method for accessing these functions with standard keyboard combinations. All alternative actions must live in a _more menu_, as defined below.
  - **Sort** â€” the header label can be clicked or `Enter` keypress to change the sort. `Shift` can be used as a modifier for `click` and `Enter` to append a sorted column to the state.
  - **More Menu** â€” There can be a secondary menu button with options to sort, filter, pin, etc. Keyboard users can access this menu with `Control + Enter`
- When a non-header row has focus within then pressing `Shift + Space` will select the row, unless the row or the parent `use-grid` is disabled.

### Aria attributes

WCAG recommended `role` and `aria-*` attributes should be automatically added to the `use-grid*` elements, this allows developers to quickly stand up an accessible grid.

It will be up to developers to implement `aria` attributes, and functionality, for sorting, filtering, readonly, etc.

## Examples

The showcase the flexibility of `use-grid` we will provide the following examples in Storybook:

- Single select mode
- Multiple select mode
- Widget cell mode
- Sticky header
- Docked columns
- Sortable data
- Value for form submission
- Master Detail view using CSS grid layout
